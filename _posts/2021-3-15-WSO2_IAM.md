## Description
IAM (Identity and access management)


### 1. Traditional access management and its issues

+ 1.1 Higher chances of data breaching, Difficulty in governance

### 2. IAM concepts and benefits:

+ 2.1 Centralized Access Management

+ 2.2 User Provisioning

+ 2.3 Single Sign-On (SSO)

+ 2.4 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

+ 2.5 Adaptive Authentication

+ 2.6 Identity Federation / Identity Federation with Social Login

+ 2.7 Privacy and Regulatory Compliance

### 3. WSO2 Identity Server features and benefits

+ 3.1 Provide Web SSO and identity federation

+ 3.2 Provide Identity bridging

+ 3.3 Support adaptive MFA

+ 3.4 Provide identity analytics

+ 3.5 Ensure API security

+ 3.6 Provide account management & identity provision

+ 3.7 Support role-based access control

+ 3.8 Support connectivity of multiple  user stores. For trad user stores, we can only choose 1 store, e.g. LDAP

### 4. Creation of User

+ 4.1. Admin creates account          

+ 4.2 Application user receives user account confirmation email for verification

### 5. Four Registration ways

+ 5.1 User Registration with Password Entry   

+ 5.2 User Registration with Email Verification

+ 5.3 Self-Registration with REST API

+ 5.4 Self-Registration with SCIM/Me API

## Overview of access delegation and OAuth 2.0 concepts

### 6. Oauth2 roles

+ 6.1 Resource owner

+ 6.2 Client application (application user)

+ 6.3 Auth server

+ 6.4 Resource server

### 7. Token types

+ 7.1 Access token: Short

+ 7.2 Refresh token: Long

+ 7.3 Authorization code: One-time

### 8. Sample access delegation scenario

+ 8.1 Application user would like to access the client application

+ 8.2 Client application sends auth request (with scope and refresh token if any) to auth server

+ 8.3 Auth server redirects the page for user to auth (Optional)

+ 8.4 User makes auth with consent

+ 8.5 Auth generates access token / refresh token for the users and sends to client application

+ 8.6 Client application sends resource server request with access token / refreshed token

+ 8.7 Resource server verify the token based on the scopes, i.e. verify user's authenticity
 
+ 8.8 If verification is successful, user will view the resource

+ 8.9 Oauth flow
![oauth_flow](https://github.com/rayyiu002/ray_TechWorld/blob/gh-pages/image/oauth_flow.png?raw=true)

### 9. User managed access (UMA) model
An OAuth based access management protocol which supports party-to-party sharing

+ 9.1 : Resource owner, Client application, auth server, resource server , requesting party (Person / party) which may not be the same one of resource owner

+ 9.2 Similar to OAuth but  the resource owner and requesting party must be the same in OAuth model.

### 10. Centralized access control vs SSO

+ 10.1 A centralized access control system e.g. LDAP results in low productivity , cost of development, low agility and poor user experience (due to different login page)

### 11. SSO via SAML

+ 11.1 XML based mark-up language

+ 11.2 SAML2 user roles: Subject/ Principal i.e. User 

+ 11.3 Client application / replying party i.e. Client application

### 12. SSO Message flow

+ 12.1 User access the service provider

+ 12.2 Service provider sends the auth request to Identity provider

+ 12.3 Identity provider validates the auth request and prompts users to input the credential e.g. password

+ 12.4 After user's input, identity provider creates session and deliver the SAML message to service provider

### 13. SAML message

+ 13.1 The message contains Name of authenticated user and other requested attributes

+ 13.2 Signed & encrypted by identity provider using its Private Key and the Service Provider validates it using the Public Key of the identity provider.

+ 13.3 Once the Service Provider validates the authentication aspects and the signature, It then creates a user session and provides the services accordingly.
